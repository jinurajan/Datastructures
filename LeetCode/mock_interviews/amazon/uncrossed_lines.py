Uncrossed Lines
We write the integers of nums1 and nums2 (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers nums1[i] and nums2[j] such that:

nums1[i] == nums2[j];
The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.



Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,4,2], nums2 = [1,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from nums1[1]=4 to nums2[2]=4 will intersect the line from nums1[2]=2 to nums2[1]=2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,5,1,2,5], nums2 = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [1,3,7,1,7,5], nums2 = [1,9,2,5,1]
Output: 2


Note:

1 <= nums1.length <= 500
1 <= nums2.length <= 500
1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 2000
