"""
Given a chessboard of size n√ón, determine how many ways n queens can be placed on the board, such that no two queens attack each other.

A queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally on a chessboard. One queen can be attacked by another queen if both share the same row, column, or diagonal.

1 <= n <= 9
