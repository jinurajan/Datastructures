"""
Design a stack-like data structure. You should be able to push elements to this data structure and pop elements with maximum frequency.

Youâ€™ll need to implement the FreqStack class that should consist of the following:

Init(): This is a constructor used to declare a frequency stack.

Push(value): This is used to push an integer data onto the top of the stack.

Pop(): This is used to remove and return the most frequent element in the stack.
