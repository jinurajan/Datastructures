Suppose that two players are playing a tic-tac-toe game on an n *n board. They are following specific rules to play and win the game:

A move is guaranteed to be valid if a mark is placed on an empty block.
No more moves are allowed once a winning condition is reached.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
