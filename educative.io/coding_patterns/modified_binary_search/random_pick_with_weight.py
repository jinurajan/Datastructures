"""
Youâ€™re given an array of positive integers, w, where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.

You need to perform weighted random selection to return an index from the w array. The larger the value of w[i], the heavier the weight is. Hence, the higher the chances of its index being picked.

Suppose the weights array contains the values [12,84,35]. In this case, the probabilities of picking the indexes will be the following:

Index 0: 12/(12+84+35)=9.2%
Index 1: 84/(12+84+35)=64.1%
Index 2: 35/(12+84+35)=26.7%
