"""
Youâ€™re given a list of non-overlapping intervals, and you need to insert another interval into the list. Each interval is a pair of non-negative numbers, the first being the start time and the second being the end time of the interval. The input list of intervals is sorted in ascending order of start time.

The intervals in the output must also be sorted by the start time, and none of them should overlap. This may require merging those intervals that now overlap as a result of the addition of the new interval.
