"""
Given strings s1 and s2, we need to transform s1 into s2 by deleting and inserting characters. Write a function to calculate the count of the minimum number of deletion and insertion operations.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abc"
       s2 = "fbc"
Output: 1 deletion and 1 insertion.
Explanation: We need to delete {'a'} and insert {'f'} to s1 to transform it into s2.
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "abdca"
       s2 = "cbda"
Output: 2 deletions and 1 insertion.
Explanation: We need to delete {'a', 'c'} and insert {'c'} to s1 to transform it into s2.
Example 3:

Input: s1 = "passport"
       s2 = "ppsspt"
Output: 3 deletions and 1 insertion
Explanation: We need to delete {'a', 'o', 'r'} and insert {'p'} to s1 to transform it into s2.
